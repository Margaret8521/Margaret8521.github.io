My name is Margaret Zhao and I graduated last year with a major in Mathematics and minor in Commerce. From a very young age, I demonstrated strong abilities in working with numbers and finding patterns with relevant materials. Sudoku was my pastime competing with friends for the pleasure of solving them in the newspaper. Collecting all types of Rubik's cube to figure out one by one was another wonder that I enjoyed. Since then, numerical and data analysis has turned out to be pursuit of my academic and career goal. Therefore, I continued my study at UBC as a Data Science student.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
